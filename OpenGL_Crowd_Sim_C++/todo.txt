why are there no matching ids for buckets
	See below

why are no buckets being added to the bucket list?
	Because of the empty condition not adding anything

why are the indices getting ridiculuously high?


Idea: 
	get buckets relative to id, so current = currentId + AND/OR - rowWidth and current, current->prev, current->next,
